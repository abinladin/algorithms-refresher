# algorithms-refresher

I'm feeling a little rusty on my algorithms, so I'm going through them again and reimplementing them. I'm uploading them here for my convenience.

## Overview:
- ```binary-search.py``` contains both iterative and recursive implementations of the algorithm
- ```selection-sort.py```
- ```quicksort.py``` uses list comprehesions to partition the quicksort.
